# IntroductionToSpring

There are three projects in this repository that introduce the Spring framework.
Spring framework is an integral part of the most Java-based corporate systems. This framework
makes it much easier to configure applications and relate components to each other. 

Spring operation principle is fully based on DI/IoC patterns.

*Stack used in this module: Java 8, Maven, Spring, Jdbc, JUnit.*

## *Exercise 00*

There are implemetantion a loosely-coupled system comprised of a set of components (beans) and compliant with IoC/DI principles.
*ApplicationContext was used to implement this project.*

## *Exercise 01*

JdbcTemplate and its extension NamedParameterJdbcTemplate are convenient mechanisms for working with databases. 
An example of a simple database is stored in the resources folder.
The connection to the postgresql database is made using the HikariCP driver.

## *Exercise 02*

Now, I have to configure Spring-application configuration mechanisms using annotations. Service application with Unit tests here.
